## Description
What does this PR change? (e.g., "Updated IK solver to handle gimbal pitch limits").

## Task Checklist
- [ ] AI: Tested with `best.pt` on sample images.
- [ ] Math: Verified Inverse Kinematics (IK) logic for singularities.
- [ ] Simulation: Tested in Gazebo/AirSim without crashes.
- [ ] Documentation: Updated `README.md` or `docs/`.

## Impact on Metrics
- **mAP Change:** (e.g., No change / +0.02)
- **Latency:** (e.g., "Inference took 15ms more per frame")

## Safety Check
- [ ] Does this code affect the drone's motor output or flight stability?
